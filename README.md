## What is AE?

AE is an open framework that extracts domain knowledge and turns it into executable lifecycle instructions. It works for libraries, apps, games, servers — any implementation. Humans and AI agents share the same deterministic workflows.

Think of AE like a USB-C port for project knowledge. Just as USB-C provides a standardized way to connect devices, AE provides a standardized way to connect domain knowledge to executable workflows.

## What can AE do?

- Extract domain knowledge from specs, docs, or git repos
- Generate deterministic install / uninstall / update / use instructions
- Store everything in a local-first hub that works offline
- Sync with remote registries when ready
- Produce deployment-ready packages
- Let AI agents and humans execute the same workflows

## Two Core Capabilities

**Know** — extract and store domain knowledge from specs, docs, repos, or any source.
**Use** — turn knowledge into executable instructions (install, uninstall, update, use).

They compose freely depending on what you need:

```text
Know alone       → implement features directly from extracted knowledge
Use alone        → manage project lifecycles with deterministic instructions
Know + Use       → generate domain-aware lifecycle files
Know + Use + Pkg → full deployment pipeline (optional)
```

## Quick Start

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fluent-meaning-symbiotic/agentic_executables/main/install.sh | bash
```

```bash
# Extract domain knowledge
ae hub init
ae know build --url https://modelcontextprotocol.io/llms-full.txt --name mcp

# Use it however you need:
ae know show --name mcp                                          # read and implement directly
ae generate --library-id my_sdk --library-root . --know mcp      # generate lifecycle files
ae registry get --library-id python_requests --action install     # or just manage a project
```

Source fallback:

```bash
cd agentic_executables_cli && dart pub get && dart run bin/ae.dart definition
```

## MCP Tools

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `ae_definition` | Framework definition |
| `ae_instructions` | Context guidance (supports `--know`) |
| `ae_generate` | Lifecycle file generation (supports `--know`) |
| `ae_registry` | Registry operations |
| `ae_hub` | Hub management |
| `ae_know` | Knowledge extraction |
| `ae_verify` | Implementation verification |
| `ae_evaluate` | Compliance evaluation |

## Architecture

| Package | Role |
|---------|------|
| `agentic_executables_core/` | Typed business logic, ports, adapters |
| `agentic_executables_cli/` | `ae` CLI (JSON-first, `--human` for readable) |
| `agentic_executables_mcp/` | MCP v3 adapter |
| `docs_site/` | VitePress docs with `/llms.txt` output |

## Ecosystem

AE works with any AI agent or IDE that supports MCP: Claude, Cursor, VS Code Copilot, Codex, and more.

Machine-readable docs are published at `/llms.txt` and `/llms-full.txt` for direct agent consumption.
